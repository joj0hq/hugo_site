## Current Situation and Issues

I have about 6 staghorn ferns at home,
and while they're relatively easy to care for,
since they originally live in warm places without winter,
ideally I'd like to somehow maintain around 15-20 degrees Celsius.
Recently, it's become relatively warmer, but since I live in the suburbs, sometimes it gets cold enough to drop below 10 degrees, so
I want to create a comfortable environment for them.

## What I Created

For now, I monitor the room temperature with a smart hub,
and made it so the heating automatically turns ON when it drops below 15 degrees, and the heating turns OFF above 22 degrees.
(Honestly, couldn't this be done just with scene settings in the existing app?)

Because it's important to keep data! I wanted to visualize it anyway, so I tried it.

Roughly, you can see it's at a temperature where staghorn ferns can grow easily.
Good. Good.
